                            Once I was Peter Pan.<br><br> I flew around the stage and I thought I was on top of the world, and I was able to tell a timeless story.  However, I really was just attatched to a cable that flew me around on the stage.  But for the kids watching, it was pure magic, and that is was made it worth it to me.<br><br>That is how I can describe my journey with coding.  Computers are magic, and even if not everyone knows exactly how it works, It still is amazing that I can take a small part to make that happen.  I live in Utah, have always loved it, and I am happily married to my wife Justine.
